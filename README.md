# Python AI Slop Calculator

A badass calculator app built purely with AI, rocking a slick GUI powered by Tkinter. This ain't your grandma's command-line calculator—it's got buttons, a window, and some sloppy-ass charm. Handles basic arithmetic and a few extra tricks, all with a vibe that's equal parts chaotic and functional.

## Features

- **Core Operations**: Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`).
- **Fancy Shit**: Percentage (`%`), reciprocal (`1/x`), square (`x²`), square root (`√`), and π (because why the fuck not?).
- **Extras**: Negate (±), backspace (⌫), and clear (C) for when you fuck up.
- **GUI Vibes**: Built with Tkinter, featuring a clean display and colorful buttons.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Smash digits, operations, and more right from your keyboard.
- **Error Handling**: Catches division by zero and other dumbass mistakes with sloppy error messages.

## Installation

1. Make sure you've got Python 3.x installed. Grab it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) if you’re slacking.
2. Clone or download this dope repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mrdwarf7/python_ai_slop_calculator.git
```

3. Slide into the project directory:

```sh
cd python_ai_slop_calculator
```

4. No extra bullshit needed—Tkinter comes with Python, so you’re good to go.

## Usage

Fire it up from the command line:

```sh
python main.py
```

or use `uv` if you're not a geriatric

```sh
uv run main.py
```

A window pops up with a calculator layout. Click buttons or use your keyboard to:

- Punch in numbers and decimals.
- Pick operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, or the fancy ones (`√`, `x²`, etc.).
- Hit `=` to see the magic happen.
- Smash `C` to reset or `⌫` to back up when you fuck up.

### Example

- Type `42`, hit `*`, type `2`, slam `=`. Boom: `84` stares back at you.
- Try `16`, hit `√`. Result: `4`, you math wizard.
- Press `π` for a sloppy 3.14159... vibe.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Digits**: `0-9` for numbers, `.` for decimals.
- **Operations**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- **Equals**: `Enter` or `Space`.
- **Clear**: `C` or `Escape`.
- **Backspace**: `Backspace`.
- **Quit**: `Q` (because fuck staying forever).

## Code Structure

- `main.py`: The whole damn thing—calculator logic, Tkinter GUI, and AI-crafted sloppiness.
